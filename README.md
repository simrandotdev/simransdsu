Software developer trying to explore different faces of engineering and learning something new everyday.

I have worked on different stacks from server to mobile and sprinkle of frontend(AngularJS) in between. A constant learner and always eager to learn more.

Currenly I am working as a iOS developer @lululemon in Canada. Previously worked @HSBC and @AltSourceSoftware.

Some technologies that I work on day to day basis:

- iOS Development 
- Android Development (My knowledge of Android deprecates faster than their APIs.)
- Ktor (Learning and Teaching at the same time)
- FastAPI
